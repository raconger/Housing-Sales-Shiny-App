## The logistics
### [Go to the app!](https://raconger.shinyapps.io/housing-sales/)

- Historical sales data was obtained from the Douglas County (NV) assessor's website
- The following parameters are used
  - Upper Kingsbury (District 430) housing sales from 2000 to 2015
  - parcel number: 131800000000:131999999999
  - date range: 0101200:05172015

The CSV file came from a query at the Douglas County, NV Assessor's office [URL](http://assessor-search.douglasnv.us:1401/cgi-bin/asw300)

## What it calculates
### [Go to the app!](https://raconger.shinyapps.io/housing-sales/)

In addition to the year and date, these pages calculate dollars per square foot and then plots it in a few different ways.

An example can be shown below:
```{r}
sale_price <- 300000 # Sale price of $300k
square_footage <- 1745 # 1,745 square feet

dol_p_sqft <- sale_price / square_footage
print(dol_p_sqft) # $/ft^2
```
